# CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python 

Welcome to my CS50AI Projects repository! This is where I will be posting my projects for CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course. In this course, I will be exploring various concepts and algorithms in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and implementing them in Python.

## Projects
Here's a list of the projects that I have completed so far:

- Project 0: Search - Implemented different search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A* search) to solve a puzzle.
- Project 1: Knowledge - Used propositional logic to solve a set of puzzles.
- Project 2: Uncertainty - Built a Bayesian network to predict the probabilities of various events.
- Project 3: Optimization - Used linear programming to optimize the allocation of resources.

## Running the Projects
To run the projects, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cs50ai-projects.git

Each project has its own directory, with a README file that explains how to run the code and what the expected output should be.

## Feedback and Contributions
I welcome any feedback on my projects, so feel free to create an issue or pull request if you notice any bugs or have any suggestions for improvement. I also welcome contributions from fellow students who are taking the course. Let's learn together!
