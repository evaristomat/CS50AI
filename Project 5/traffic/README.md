# Traffic 

This project involves building and training a convolutional neural network to classify images of traffic signs. Throughout the project, a variety of techniques and approaches were tried to improve the accuracy of the model.

During my experimentation process, I started by following the given instructions and implemented the load_data and get_model functions. Then, I experimented with different model architectures to improve the accuracy of the classification.

At first, I tried using only one convolutional layer and a few fully connected layers, but the model's accuracy was only around 60%. Then, I added more convolutional layers, max pooling, and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. With this architecture, the accuracy improved to around 90%.
